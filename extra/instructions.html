<p>The 
<a href='https://www.thomas.co/sites/default/files/thomas-files/2022-09/Aptitude%20Example%20Booklet_2021%20V1.pdf'>instruction / example booklet</a> 
is still in the same place (for now), so it gives you the gory details.
</p>

<p>The short version: go to the <a href='/t/23/04/IQ/front/menuMain.php'>main menu</a>.  Select a task, numbers 1 - 5.  For the first task, you 
first read the question then click to get the possible answers.  For all tasks, click one of the 
darker-blue-background answers.  If you're in immediate feedback mode, 
click anywhere on the screen (but preferably not on an answer) to proceed to the next question.
</p>

<p>To change tasks or see the results of all questions, hover over the far right of the screen.  </p>

<p>In "none" feedback mode, the test goes to the next question without indicating results.   
 In either mode, you can go to the "results" link to see results.  There is no distinction between your answers 
and any others taking the test before, after, or at the same time as you.  (This lack of distinct users might keep me from getting sued.)
</p>

<p>Anyone taking the test can switch modes.  Again, there are no distinct users.
</p>

<p>In the results, "cor" is the correct answer and "you" is your answer, or anyone taking the test.  The number next to the check (correct answer) 
or X (wrong answer) is the task number.

</p>

<p>This was written in a hurry for a real computer screen, not a phone.  You'd have to motivate me to make it mobile friendly.
